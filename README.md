# Ethereum Donation Banners

## Objective

This application should allow an open source project to track donations made to it (or to some entity,
such as a charity). It will provide a banner (like TravisCI build status) with the donations-to-date.
Clicking into the banner provides an interface to show donations made, when, and by who (if not anonymous).
